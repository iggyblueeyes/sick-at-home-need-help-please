	<h3>What if I test positive?</h3>
	<p>
	  Serving people with Covid symptoms puts you at risk.
	  That's why we put a lot of thought into our sick leave policy.
	  We care about our service providers as much as our customers.
	  Given a positive test, we have a 7-day quarantine policy for all of our service providers.
	  We'll pay you while you're sick.
	  We pay you the amount you earned over the last 7 days.

	<h3>Do I get benefits?</h3>
	<p>
	  As of right now we are not offering benefits.
	  We are too small to do so.
	  Ideally you have benefits through another organization.
	  We hope to soon offer benefits as we grow and serve more people in need.
