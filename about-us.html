      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>
	We're a service-focused tech startup based in the Greater Phoenix Area.
      </p>
      <p>
	We're serving the community by providing access to supplies and testing to those suffering with Covid symptoms at home.
	We'll even talk them to a Covid testing center if they can't get there by themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
	We are limiting our focus to the City of Tempe, and we plan to expand to the whole of the Greater Phoenix Area:
	Mesa, Phoenix, Gilbert, Chandler, Scottsdale, Scottsdale, Glendale, ect.
	We will expand as soon as we are confident that we can provide quality service.
	We'll be in your city sooner than you think!
      </p>
      <p>
	Our founder is a grad school drop out and is on staff at a K-8th school in Phoenix.
	Originally from Tennessee, he's lived in the Greater Phoenix Area for 4+ years.
	He loves the desert and the desert people.
      </p>
      <p>
	We'll put more about our story here as it evolves. Stay tuned!
