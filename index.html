	<h3>How do I sign up for the service?</h3>

	<h3>What is the service?</h3>
	<p>
	  We serve you in a few ways.
	</p>
	<p>
	  First, if you need to get to a testing center, we will set up an appointment for you and
	  will get you to and from your place of residence.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Second, we offer Covid Supply Boxes, which are essentially all the things you need to get better.
	  You don't need to go to the store yourself.
	  We'll deliver to you.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Third, we can give you a free rapid test at your place of residence if you don't need a PCR test.
	</p>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-question">
	<h3>Why would I need a PCR test over a rapid test?</h3>
	<p>
	  Both are free, so it's not about the price.
	  You might need a PCR test if
	  you want the most accurate test, or
	  your employer requires that you need a test done by certified lab for documentation.
	  It's possible you won't get sick leave unless you provide a lab-evaluated test to your employer.
	</p>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-question">
	<h3>Why should I donate my rapid tests?</h3>
	<p>
	  We are asking for donations of rapid tests because frequently we serve under-represented groups.
	  We serve the elderly, single mothers, the disabled, ect.
	</p>
	<p>
	  We would like to give rapid tests out for free, but we don't have a sourse of free tests.
	  We are working to find a source, but until then we rely on your generosity.
	  We don't profit on rapid tests, selling them at the average price that they cost us.
	  Donate them and it helps reduce the cost to $0!
	</p>
	<p>
	  Donating rapid tests is almost free you to. 
	  The US federal government allows you to order 4 rapid tests for free with no shipping cost.
	  Order them, wait 7 - 12 days for them to show up to your residence, then ship them to us.
	  The shipping will cost you a few dollars.
